## Overview

Skin diseases are prevalent worldwide and can vary significantly in symptoms and severity. Early and accurate diagnosis of these diseases is crucial for effective treatment. Traditional diagnosis methods often rely on visual inspection by dermatologists, which can be subjective and time-consuming. 

The Skin Disease Classifier project leverages deep learning techniques to automate the classification process and provide quick and accurate diagnoses. By analyzing skin disease images, the classifier can identify various conditions, including acne, eczema, psoriasis, melanoma, and more.

## Features

Multi-class Classification: Classifies skin disease images into multiple categories, allowing for comprehensive diagnosi
Transfer Learning: Utilizes transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models to achieve high accuracy, even with limited training data.
Easy-to-Use Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for making predictions on new images, making it accessible to medical professionals and researchers.
